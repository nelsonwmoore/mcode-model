            is related to a primary or secondary cancer condition. In the context
            of chemotherapy drugs, the medication administration in most cases is
            performed and documented by the provider.

            and [US Core Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.html)
            is that Patient.deceased is a [must-support](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html#mustsupport)
            element in mCODE. Must-support is an instruction to implementers of FHIR
            clients and servers, rather than a constraint on data structure. Any Patient
            resource complying with US Core Patient Profile will also comply with
            CancerPatient.

            Profiles for different staging systems (e.g., TNM stage group, Rai stage,
            FIGO stage, etc.) must derive from this profile.


            Despite its name, the CancerStage profile can also be used as a parent
            for cancer grade, classification, and risk grouping. This is because the
            structure of the profiles are the same or very similar. The key elements
            are the code, method, value, and optionally, prognostic factors referenced
            in the hasMember element.'

            may be benign, pathogenic, or of unknown significance. The term variant
            is increasingly being used in place of the term mutation. Variants can
            be computed relative to reference sequence assembly from which it was

            test, where a specific mutation on a specific gene is tested for. The
            result is either positive or negative for that mutation. The second type
            is a more general test for variants. This type of test returns the identity
            of variants found in a certain region of the genome.

            therapies and to help assess the prognosis of certain patients, such as
            those with certain cancers. The KPS score ranges from 0 to 100 in intervals
            of 10. Higher scores are associated with better functional status, with
            100 representing no symptoms or evidence of disease, and 0 representing
            death.
